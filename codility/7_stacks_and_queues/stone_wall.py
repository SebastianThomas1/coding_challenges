# StoneWall
#
# Cover "Manhattan skyline" using the minimum number of rectangles.
#
# You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N
# meters long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should
# have different heights in different places. The height of the wall is
# specified by an array H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of
# the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end. In
# particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is
# the height of the wall's right end.
#
# The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of
# such blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum
# number of blocks needed to build the wall.
#
# Write a function:
#   def solution(H)
# that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of
# the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
#
# For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
#   H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
#   H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
#   H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
# the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible
# arrangement of seven blocks.
#
# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
#   - N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
#   - each element of array H is an integer within the range
#     [1..1,000,000,000].

        while height < current_height:
            current_height = previous_heights.pop()
            count += 1

        # build up
        if height > current_height:
            previous_heights.append(current_height)
            current_height = height

    return count + len(previous_heights)
